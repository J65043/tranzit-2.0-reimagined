Remove all previous scripts if you have them installed.
You can either rename the script folder to something else or delete it permanently.

Press Win key + R and paste the following line in there and press enter.
%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6

if you don't have folders called scripts and images  inside of t6 folder, create them.

Inside of scripts folder, create a folder called zm. Create a folder called zm_transit inside of "zm" -folder

Drag all the gsc files downloaded from the git link that I provided inside of your zm_transit folder.

Now back to t6/images folder... 
  Paste all custom textures inside of images folder.

After all this, remove the t6r folder from your bo2 root folder.
